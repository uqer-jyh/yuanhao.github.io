I am a bioinformatician with a keen interest in computational biology, multi-omics, and biomedical image analysis. My research project focuses on building a multi-omics subtyping system to provide comprehensive biological understanding of brain tumour. I previously worked as a research assistant at [IMB](https://imb.uq.edu.au/) within the University of Queensland and was affiliated with [QIMR Berghofer](https://www.qimrberghofer.edu.au/), under the supervision of Associate Professor Quan Nguyen. Before joining IMB, I completed my postgraduate studies at UQ, where I had the privilege of working with Dr. Nan Ye and Associate Professor Quan Nguyen.
